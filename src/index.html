      Here is a brief overview of the rapper's story,
      <li> Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion (/ˌɛksˌɛksˌɛksˌtɛntəsˈjɒn/),[3]
      was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. In a career spanning over five years, Onfroy's music has encompassed trap,
      hip hop, rap metal, alternative rock, emo, indie and grunge.
    </li>
      <li>
        Born in Plantation, Florida, Onfroy spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released
        from a youth correction center[4] and released his first song on SoundCloud in June 2013, titled "News/Flock".[5] He was
        a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s.[6][7][8] Well known
        for his "depressing, and at times devastating" music that brought attention to mental health, Onfroy employed styles and
        techniques that were unconventional in hip hop during his career, such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals
        drawing inspiration from third-wave emo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onfroy rose to fame with the release of his song "Look at Me". He released his debut album, 17, on August 25, 2017. The album
        debuted at No. 2 on the US Billboard 200, selling 86,000 album-equivalent units first week. The album received a positive
        response from critics, some of which lauded the album for its personal narratives and diverse musical style.
        <li>Onfroy's second album, ?, was released on March 16, 2018. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with its singles
          "Sad!" and "Changes" both reaching the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on June
          26, 2018.</li>
      
        <li>On June 18, 2018, Onfroy died after being gunned down by an armed assailant as he left a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield
          Beach, Florida.[9] The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing a bag from Onfroy, and the suspected shooter
          was arrested by police in his native Pompano Beach, and charged with the murder.[10] In the week following his murder,
          Onfroy's highest-charting single, "Sad!", went from 52nd to 1st on the Billboard Hot 100, making Onfroy the first artist
          to top the Hot 100 posthumously in a lead role since The Notorious B.I.G., with "Mo Money Mo Problems", in 1997. </li>
        <li>Onfroy left behind what Rolling Stone called "a huge musical footprint" due to his impact on his young fanbase and
          his popularity during his career.</li>
